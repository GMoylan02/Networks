Routing: Routers all communicate to get an idea of where all other routers are and how to get to them efficiently
can occur across multiple networks

Forwarding: Using the knowledge gained from routing, and given a packet with a destination, know who to forward
the packet to

Each router has a forwarding table where
key = destination node
value = next node to go to in order to reach destination node
so for each possible destination, the router has stored what it believes to be the best possible next step

header: (subject to change)
1 byte: booleans
2 bytes: packet id (random)
4 bytes: src address
4 bytes: destination address
total: 11 bytes

bools:
1 bit: ack

when a router receives a packet, check to see if that packet has been seen before, if not, add it to list, then broadcast.
