Routing: Routers all communicate to get an idea of where all other routers are and how to get to them efficiently
can occur across multiple networks

Forwarding: Using the knowledge gained from routing, and given a packet with a destination, know who to forward
the packet to

Each router has a forwarding table where
key = destination node
value = next node to go to in order to reach destination node
so for each possible destination, the router has stored what it believes to be the best possible next step

header: (subject to change)
1 byte: booleans
2 bytes: packet id (random)
4 bytes: src address
4 bytes: destination address
total: 11 bytes

bools:
1 bit: dest_is_known

when a router receives a packet, check to see if that packet has been seen before, if not, add it to list, then broadcast.

when a router receives a packet for an unknown destination, broadcast to all other routers asking if they know the destination
store current destination and the router that requested that dest and wait for response.
when a router receives a packet for an known destination, reply to the sender saying dest_is_known.
when a router receiver a reply saying dest_is_known, store the sender to that reply and the dest in fwd table,
send msg saying dest_is_known to the router that requested it.
