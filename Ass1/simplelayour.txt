networks assignment 1 simple layout:

sender_id:3 - stream no:1 - frame_no:1 - is_announce:1 - ping_recd:1 - is_ping:1 - is_subscription:1
total header 9 bytes

sender_id: id of the producer/consumer sending a message, all zeroes if from broker
stream_no: number of the stream, 0 if n/a
frame_no: number of the frame, 0 if n/a
is_announce: 1 if the packet is announcing a stream, 0 otherwise
ping_recd: 1 if broker is telling someone a ping is received, 0 otherwise
is_ping: 1 if the packet is a ping, 0 otherwise




producer header: id: 3 bytes, first byte must be 0xAA
                 stream_no: 1 byte, 00 if N/A
                 frame_no: 1 byte.  00 if N/A
                 type: 1 byte. 0x01 for announcement, 0x00 if the payload is a frame
                 total 6 bytes for producer header

Broker header when announcing: same header as producer

broker header when forwarding: same header as producer

broker header when responding to ping:
                consumer id, 3 bytes
                1 signalling the ping has been received


consumer header: id: 3 bytes, first byte must be 0xCC
                 stream number: 1 byte
                 is ping: 1 byte. 0x01 if true, 0x00 if false
